## Description

A website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings, a size to order a pizza, and see the final cost. Made for my Independent Project in Week 4 of Epicodus Coding School.

This project will:
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen using my own formula.

## TDD

Describe: NiceSlice()

* Test One
Test: "It should return a NiceSlice object with two properties for toppings and size."
Code: 
let niceSlice = new NiceSlice("regular", ["pineapple", "jalapeno"]);
Expected Output: niceSlice¬†{pizzaSize: 'regular', pizzaTopping:["pineapple" "jalapeno"]}

<!-- function NiceSlice(pizzaSize, pizzaTopping) {
  this.pizzaSize = pizzaSize;
  this.pizzaTopping = pizzaTopping;
} -->

*Test Passes*

Describe: NiceSlice.prototype.orderSummary

* Test One
Test: "It should add the cost of the pizza's size and toppings together and return the total cost of the pizza."
Code: 
niceSlice.OrderSummary ()
Expected Output: (Based on this particular bit of user input) NiceSlice {pizzaSize: 20, pizzaTopping: 12, pizzaCost: 32}

<!-- NiceSlice.prototype.orderSummary = function() {
  this.pizzaCost = (this.pizzaSize + this.pizzaTopping);
  return this.pizzaCost;
} -->

*Test Passes*

## Setup/Installation Requirements
