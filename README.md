## Description

A website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings, a size to order a pizza, and see the final cost. Made for my Independent Project in Week 4 of Epicodus Coding School.

This project will:
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen using my own formula.

## TDD

Describe: function()

* Test One
Test: "It should ‚Äù  example: return an array of numbers from 0 to 5."
Code: 
const input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
fredBot(input);]
Expected Output: example:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository to your desktop.
* Open the files and visit the website to order a nice slice!

* If there are any questions or concerns please reach out to Eliot at eliot.lauren@gmail.com.

## Known Bugs

* Bugs here:
* More toppings and custom styles of pizza can always be added! There's no such thing as too much pizza!
