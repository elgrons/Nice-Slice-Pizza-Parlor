## Description

A website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings, a size to order a pizza, and see the final cost. Made for my Independent Project in Week 4 of Epicodus Coding School.

This project will:
* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen using my own formula.

## TDD

Describe: NiceSlice()

* Test One
Test: "It should return a Pizza object with two properties for toppings and size"
Code: 
let niceSlice = new NiceSlice("regular", ["pineapple", "jalapeno"]);
Expected Output: niceSlice {pizzaSize: 'regular', pizzaTopping:["pineapple" "jalapeno"]}

*Test Passes*

* Test Two
Test: "It should "
Code: 

Expected Output: 




Describe NiceSlice.prototype.chooseSize

* Test One
Test: "It should return a Pizza object with two properties for toppings and size"
Code: 
const niceSlice = new Pizza(["pineapple", "jalapeno"], "regular");
Expected Output: Pizza { toppings: ["pineapple", "jalapeno"],], size: "regular" }

Describe NiceSlice.prototype.chooseTopping

* Test One
